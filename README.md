# subunit_enrichment

The purpose of this workflow is to generete gap junction particle.cs files that have been enriched for a desired state that can be imported back into CryoSPARC for high resolution refinement.


IMPORTANT:
These scripts rely on analyzing a .csv file with three columns using metadata extracted from a .cs file generated from CryoSPARC in a specific order: uid, sym_expand/idx and sym_expand/src_uid.

The intended input for these scripts is metadata that was extracted from a .cs file from gap junction particles that were symmetry expanded and signal subtracted to obtain a connexin monomer and that have gone through 3D classification. Each classâ€™s .cs will need to have its metadata extracted to a .csv file and analyzed by the scripts individually.

Step # 1: Generate/acquire the necessary files to begin:

1) Extracted metadata .csv from the subunit state of interest
   - Start by following [Steps #1 - 7 in the subunit_analysis repository](https://github.com/reichow-lab/subunit_analysis/blob/main/README.md) to generate the required metadata .csv files

2) Exported .cs file from an unbinned consensus refinement
   - This refinement must contain all particles that eventually went into the symmetry expansion/signal subtraction/3D classification workflow

Using the Metadata_Enrichment.sh script

Step # 2: Load the script
```
./Metadata_Enrichment.sh
```
Enter the path to the metadata .csv file of interest

After seeing the distribution, input the number of subunits that is wanted for enrichment

This will create a new "enriched_values" .csv file containing particle IDs that fit the selected criteria that is used with the Metadata_filter/py script

Optional: rename the the enriched_values.csv with # of enriched subunits (e.g. 10gated_enriched_values.csv) and repeat the script using another enrichment criteria.

Typical use case is to generate several enriched_values.csv files of different amounts of the desired state to be enriched that get independently used in the script below. 
The end goal being several particles.cs files with varying amounts of the desired state in the gap junction

Using the Metadata_Filter.py script

Step # 3: Load the the script

```
python3 Metadata_Filter.py
```
Enter the path to the consensus refinement .cs file
Enter the path to the enriched_values.csv file

This script will create a new gap junction particle.cs file named "filtered_particles.cs" that can be imported into CryoSPARC
